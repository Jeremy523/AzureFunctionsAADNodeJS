# WebAPI Glossary
This glossary is intended to help those less familiar with Identity, Azure, and other relevant terms and concepts to get up to speed for this scenario.

It goes into some specifics that may be helpful but the official Microsoft documentation is always the recommended place to start. For a general overview and list of common terminology, check out the Microsoft identity platform [overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview) and [glossary](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/developer-glossary)
. 

If you're new to identity entirely, [this article](https://winsmarts.com/the-absolute-basics-of-identity-7e373cc0a85c) is another good resource to start with.
