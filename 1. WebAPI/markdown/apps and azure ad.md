# Azure AD Applications and Service Principals
One relationship that can be confusing at first is that between the application you register on Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and the application you are developing (be it a web app, an API, etc.). In Azure, when you register an application, an [Application Object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/developer-glossary#application-object) is created. The "application" you're developing, on the other hand, is referred to as a [Service Principal Object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/developer-glossary#service-principal-object).

This is oftentimes related to misunderstandings regarding terminology. See Microsoft's [Applications and Service Principals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals) documentation outlining the key differences.
